# Dive into Java space

A lot of demo's of java features by version.

Important note!
If you open this project in an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse you will get a lot 
of errors.
This comes from the fact that many features need a specific version of java or 
special options added to the commands.
the folders starting with java<version> are not packages.

# Usage

Start a docker with the correct jdk by using:

```shell
# ./jstart [version]
# e.g.
./jstart.sh 15
# or
./jstart.sh 17
```
